# CS50 Sudoku Final Project 
## TESTING.md

## Testing Process
For the `testing.sh`:
First, we tried various erroneous input lines to check our input validation.
Then, we testing the solver on premade sudoku puzzles.
Then, we tested create on *easy*, *medium*, and *hard* mode.
Finally, we testing the create and solve in unison on *easy*, *medium*, and *hard* mode.
We also included a memory leak check on a create and solve command.

For macros testing, we used the following flags:

For `UNITTEST`:
This test loads a puzzle, solves the puzzle, and then prints the output.

For `CREATETEST`:
This test isolates and tests the sudoku_build() method and prints out the generated puzzle.

* Note: We understand these puzzle do not look randomly generated. This is because our seed relies on time. If you run two create commands separately in your terminal, you will get two random puzzles.

### Testing Improper Input
In this section, we test no arguments, one argument, and create mode without a gameDifficulty.

### Testing Valid Input
Then we tested all the different ways to create and solve puzzles with premade files and files generated by our program.


### Testing with FuzzQuery
In order to test with fuzztesting, run `make fuzz` in the command line.
